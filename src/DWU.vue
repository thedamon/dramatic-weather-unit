 - Whenever <span>you’re</span> taken by a strange urge  
 - and you find yourself standing in the middle of the street  
 - in your cul de sac  
 - your arms thrust up toward the sky  
 - your heart pounding  
 - the wind whipping past you  
 - the leaves thrown around you in a vortex  



 - And your brain is screaming with delight 
 - as clouds pile on clouds pile on deep deep eerie grey  
 - and the clouds come toward you
 - like the hordes of heaven and hell together  
 - and at any moment the sky will be torn apart 
 - and the rain will tumble out 
 - with a fury unimaginable.  

And in this strange humid moment you can feel it about to happen.  

You can feel it so clearly.  

It.  
  

<div class="-r">
  
And then you go inside.  
Sip at your beer.  
Maybe tidy up the kitchen counter.</div>

That’s when they’ve failed.

Because the Dramatic Weather Unit knows *that’s* when **it** *should* have happened.  
And if they’re in your town, they’ll make sure it does.  


They’re the guys.  
 
 - They’ll make sure, that when that 
 - “feeling’s in the air”,

1. that that feeling is not *just* 
<div class="-c">“in the air.”  </div>

O they will, alright.

Alright!

They check their forecast.  

> (Their forecast, not yours.)  
> (Your forecast is often off by a day or a whole degree.)  
> (Theirs is not.)  
> (They’ve got connections high at the bureau.)  
> (So they know.)

 - They circle maps.  
 - Draw hexagons on graph paper.  
 - And nod at each other like they know,  
<div class="-c">you know?</div>

> *(They know.)*

Then they’re ready to go.  
They roll out all serious.

<span class="radio">*A cold front is moving toward the Eastern seaboard, creating a weather system here and here. With weather events from here to about here expected developing over the weekend, tapering off into the KSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH SHHHH Waaaaaaaaa. Btbtbtbt*</span>

They roll in all serious.  
Eyes hidden up behind dark rain or shine glasses.  
Black gloves on tight.  
Suits just so.  

The dramatic weather unit has arrived, ladies and gentlemen.  

Your tax dollars at work!

Ever since way back then, yes, back, there, in the day, when a lawmaker looked up from his desk and out the window at all that out there and proclaimed:

## *Never should a sunshower be wasted!*

 - Nor a thunderstorm.  
 - Nor the whipping blizzard.  
 - Nor that subtle, just-so breeze in the heady summer night.



 - From that height of a lofty ideal emerged the 
 - rutty, 
 - nitty gritty 
 - of reality.  

Plans drawn up.  
Plans scaled back.  
Budget cuts and  
corners cut. 

They’d be called "the meteorillogical agency", or worse, pathetic, and a preposterous fallacy.  
But you have to make concessions, here and there, to exist within a system that doesn’t intrinsically value your perspective on which shit matters — and which shit’s shit.

<div class="-c">

So, ladies and gentlemen,  
as the fiscal year draws to its close,  
we ask you to shut up, and go outside,  
and think about every moment of beauty  
and every life given meaning.

### This is the Dramatic Weather Unit.


When they’re successful they’re invisible. They just plant the seeds for the wind and the rain and then you to harvest.

A mission success is a feeling deeply felt in unity with the planet.  
And when they nail it, it goes deep and it echoes and it persists and it ricochets in unexpected geometries. Like there’s layers under everything. Like there’s more.

And don’t count on it  

 - Maybe just dream on it, that
 - the string on the pin on their map,  
 - and the same string on the other pin on their map, 
 - connected,
 - casts a shadow over your cul de sac.  

And maybe you’d be so lucky.  

And then *it* would have happened.

<LittleFluffyClouds raining></LittleFluffyClouds>

 - Heavy news on such a heavy day
 > (Oh, the humidity!)

 - A stranger stranded in the mist.  
 - A ray of sunlight acts as a spotlight.  
 - Sheets and sheets and sheets of rain.  
 - A light in the fog.  
 - A thick pillow of snow to suppress the cries.

And then, as the snow melts and warm fingers of sunshine cut through the winter for the first time this year, they’ll send you outside with someone. Just for a casual stroll, maybe grab lunch? And whoever it is, you *will* fall in love with that person.

And in late fall, when the air falls cold as fast as the wind can clear it away, and the dry leaves skitter and whirl over the asphalt — They spark the wanderlust in you again, without even lifting a finger.
